# Notes: July 3rd, 2019
Notes and tasks from Week 01.

----

## Class Discussion
Notes taken as a class (8:30 - 9:30am)

### Uses
- Taking notes in class
- Daily todo list
- Reminders
- Sketching / drawing
- Articles to read (offline reading)

### Challenges
- Filing notes in a way that I will remember down the road
  - Hacking it: "What will I search the next time Im looking for this"
- Combining sketches and notes is difficult
- Portability of proper sketching tools is limiting
- Organization is a priority
- Similar topics across multiple docs not organized
- Overwhelming amount of notes that I could not possibly go back on

### Class Note Taking Application
Into two teams of three, discuss (and take notes) the needs for a student who is struggling with taking and using digital notes in the classroom (can be specific to this program or general student)
- What are YOUR needs as a student?
- Where are current applications not serving those needs?
- Try sketching a few possible interfaces

## Group Discussion
Notes taken in two groups (9:30-10:30am)

### Group Left
Leah [@leahchow](https://github.com/leahchow), Damian [@DamianSpaziani](https://github.com/DamianSpaziani), Gabriela [@kostovagm](https://github.com/kostovagm)

#### Needs:
As a student, I want to be able to:
- see my folders easily 
- see the text content of my search results (not just the file names) 
- be able to organize and search content by tags, both inside the content (to tag paragraphs); and outside (tag full document)
- have the option to automatically combine related information together into a new folder or document 
- have an easy way to add appointments and deadlines from notes into calendar

#### Frustrations with current applications e.g., Google Calendar:
- Getting lost and having a hard time organizing your notes; 
- Having to manually combine related information from multiple documents;
- When searching for a keyword, only see the file names; not the content;
- Folders are not sufficiently prominent; itâ€™s hard to see them; 
- Not an easy way to connect appt notes to calendar

#### App Ideas:
- No more static traditional folders, folders are dynamic and created from our tags; When we create a file, we add tags; The interface shows tags as dynamic folders that you can click to display documents with that particular tag
- Inside each document, we mark off content and tag it with tags as well; when we search tags, we can view all tagged content and combine it into a new document with a button (if we want to)
- We can select content and automaticlaly create an appointment in google calendar from it using tags

### Group Right

- The notes app will be robust, allowing different types of content in one note.
  - Scanning/inserting an image
  - Using the camera for photos + videos
  - Being able to markup the content using the tools in the app
  - Sketching: freehand sketches should be possible, with different tool options
  - Free flowing, being able to fluently switch between different content through one note
- Sketching in notes is very important
- Ability to use pens, markers, and other tools
  - Select tools and sizes, colour, etc.
- Searchability of notes is important, using keywords, possibly tagging of notes (automagically???)
  - Should be able to seach any word in the note and find it
  - OCR 
- Organizing of notes into clusters/folders --> also automagically???
  - Could pull keywords from notes and match across other notes to find similarities and suggest groupings
- Sorting and heirarchy of notes, and naming automatically (based off first line in note)
- Syncing to cloud, being able to access from different devices (live update?) 
- Collaborating, being able to share and send notes, as well as being able to work on same note at the same time
